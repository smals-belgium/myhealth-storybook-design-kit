# Autocomplete

> The autocomplete component is based of Angular Material's [autocomplete](https://material.angular.io/components/autocomplete). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

The autocomplete utilises the [form field component](/docs/components-form-field--docs) for its styling.
You must therefore also include the form field component in your project.
Make sure to also include the `mh-form-field` class (described in the [form field component](/docs/components-form-field--docs)) around the autocomplete component, if you want to achieve the desired label.

To use the **autocomplete component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-form-field();
@include mh.override-mat-autocomplete();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

### Keyboard Arrow icon

The `mat-autocomplete` does not automatically come with an `keyboard_arrow_down` icon in the suffix of the input field.

Here's an example on how you can add it to your code:

```html
<mat-icon matSuffix>{{ suffixIcon() }}</mat-icon>
<mat-autocomplete #auto="matAutocomplete" (opened)="isOpen.set(true)" (closed)="isOpen.set(false)"></mat-autocomplete>
```

And this TypeScript code to make it work:

```ts
readonly isOpen: WritableSignal<boolean> = signal(false);
readonly suffixIcon: Signal<string> = computed(() => (this.isOpen() ? 'keyboard_arrow_up' : 'keyboard_arrow_down'));
```
