# FAB Button

> The button component is based of Angular Material's [button](https://material.angular.io/components/button). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **FAB button component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

The `$dark-theme` variable is optional and defaults to `false` when it is not included. It allows you to set the theme of the FAB button to dark or light.

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-button-fab($dark-theme);
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

### Dark & light themes

The FAB button component is available in both dark and light themes. To use the dark or light theme **everywhere**, set the `$dark-theme` variable to `true` or `false` respectively when including the styles:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-button-fab(true);
```

Alternatively, you can set the dark and light themes on one specific button using the `dark-mat-fab-button()` and `light-mat-fab-button()` mixins:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

button.dark {
  @include mh.dark-mat-fab-button();
}

button.light {
  @include mh.light-mat-fab-button();
}
```

Note that the `light` and `dark` classes are just examples. You can use any class name you want.
The important part is to include the `dark-mat-fab-button()` or `light-mat-fab-button()` mixin inside the class.
