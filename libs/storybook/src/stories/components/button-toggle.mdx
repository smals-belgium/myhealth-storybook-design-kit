# Button toggle

> Segmented button let users choose from a set of options, side-by-side.
>
> The button toggle component is based of Angular Material's [button toggle](https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.
>
> It should be noted that the Material buttons in the button toggle use a slightly resized version of the MH button style, this is to better fit the button toggle.

## Usage

To use the **button toggle component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-button-toggle();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

## Usage guidelines

Use when two to five options are available.

When an option is selected, the color of the button is changed and a check sign is added in order to clearly indicate the status of the option.

As much as possible, use content with a similar size in each segment.

This component is based on the use of a label instead of an icon (which is prohibited given the presence of a check when the option is selected).

Because segmented buttons are an alternative for radio buttons and checkboxes, try to be consistent: avoid mixing those components on the same screen.

Depending on the type of selection, there are 2 categories segmented buttons:

- **Single-select buttons**
  Single-select buttons are an alternative to radio buttons in which mutually exclusive options are presented on a horizontal axis.
  Only one option can be selected at a time. When a user chooses a new item, the previous choice is automatically deselected.
  For example, a segmented control can help people switch between calendar views (e.g. Day, Week, Month)<br />

- **Multi-select button**
  Multi-select button are an alternative to checkboxes where multiple options can be combined.
  To indicate the possibility of selecting several items, be sure to mention this beforehand (e.g. ‘select one or more options’).
