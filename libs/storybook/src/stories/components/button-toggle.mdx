# Button toggle

> Segmented button lets users choose from a set of options, side-by-side.
>
> The button toggle component is based of Angular Material's [button toggle](https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.
>
> It should be noted that the Material buttons in the button toggle use a slightly resized version of the MH button style, this is to better fit the button toggle.

## Usage

To use the **button toggle component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-button-toggle();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

## Usage guidelines

Depending on the type of selection, there are 2 categories segmented buttons:

- **Single-select buttons** are an alternative to radio buttons. They present mutually exclusive options arranged horizontally.

  - Only one option can be selected at a time.
  - Selecting a new option automatically deselects the previous one.
  - Example: Switching between calendar views such as Day, Week, or Month using a segmented control.
  - See also <a href="/?path=/docs/angular-components-selectors--docs">Selectors</a>

- **Multi-select buttons** are an alternative to checkboxes, allowing users to select multiple options simultaneously.
  - Always **communicate clearly** that multiple selections are allowed (e.g., “Select one or more options”).

### When to use it

- Use a segmented button when there are **two to five available options**.
- When an option is selected, **highlight it with a different color and a checkmark** to clearly show its selected status.
- Ensure each segment contains **content of similar size** whenever possible, to maintain a balanced appearance.
- This component should use **labels only, not icons**, since icons (such as a checkmark) are already used to indicate selection.
- Because segmented buttons serve as alternatives to radio buttons and checkboxes, be consistent in your UI — **avoid using them together on the same screen**.
