# Button toggle

> The button toggle component is based of Angular Material's [button toggle](https://material.angular.io/components/button-toggle). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.
>
> It should be noted that the Material buttons in the button toggle use a slightly resized version of the MH button style, this is to better fit the button toggle.

## Usage

To use the **button toggle component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-button-toggle();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```
