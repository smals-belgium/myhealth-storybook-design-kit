# Card

> The card component is based of Angular Material's [card](https://material.angular.io/components/card). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.
>
> It should be noted that the Material buttons in the card use a slightly resized version of the MH button style, this is to better fit the card.

## Usage

To use the **card component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-card();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```
