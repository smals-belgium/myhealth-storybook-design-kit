# Chips

> The chips component is based of Angular Material's [chips](https://material.angular.io/components/chips). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **chips component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-chips();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

### Colored chips

`mat-chip` elements can be colored by adding one of the following classes to the `mat-chip` element:

- `mh-blue`
- `mh-green`
- `mh-red`
- `mh-yellow`
- `mh-orange`
- `mh-black`

Not adding a class will resuled in the default color of the `mat-chip` element.

Adding the parameter `--outline` to the class will add a border around the chip, and remove the background color.

```html
<mat-chip [disableRipple]="true" class="mh-blue">Blue chip</mat-chip>
```

### Disabling hover overlay

`mat-chip` have a hover overlay effect by default, that changes the opacity of the chip.
The hover overlay can be disabled by adding the `mh-no-overlay` class to the `mat-chip` element.
This class can be combined with the color classes.

```html
<mat-chip [disableRipple]="true" class="mh-blue mh-no-overlay">Blue chip</mat-chip>
```
