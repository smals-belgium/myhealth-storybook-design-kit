# Dialog

> The dialog component is based of Angular Material's [dialog](https://material.angular.io/components/dialog). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **dialog component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-dialog();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

When calling the `dialog.open()` method, pass the **custom class** `mh-dialog-container` from My Health into the `panelClass` option to use My Health styling:

```ts
openDialog(): void {
  this.dialog.open(DialogComponent, {
    panelClass: 'mh-dialog-container',
  });
}
```
