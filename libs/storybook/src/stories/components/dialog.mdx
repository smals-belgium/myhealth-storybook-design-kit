# Dialog

> A modal dialog displays content that requires user interaction, in a layer above the page.
>
> It appears in front of page content to provide information or ask for a decision. Modal dialogs disable all page functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.
>
> The dialog component is based of Angular Material's [dialog](https://material.angular.io/components/dialog). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **dialog component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-dialog();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

When calling the `dialog.open()` method, pass the **custom class** `mh-dialog-container` from My Health into the `panelClass` option to use My Health styling:

```ts
openDialog(): void {
  this.dialog.open(DialogComponent, {
    panelClass: 'mh-dialog-container',
  });
}
```

## Usage guidelines

### When to use it

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

- **Grab the user's attention**: Use when you want to interrupt a user's current task to catch the user's full attention to something more important.
- **Need user input**: Use when you want to get information from the user.
- **Show additional information in context**: Use when you want to show additional information without losing the context of the parent page.

### Anatomy

- **Header area**:
  This part contains the title and/or the subtitle of the overlayer.

- **Content area**:
  It contains the main content of your overlayer. You are free to compose your own content with simple components from the library, avoid complex components.

- **Footer area (optional)**:
  The footer should contain only button(s).

- **Close button**:
  There should always be a way to dismiss the overlayer.
  Usually it will be a close button. When a cancel button is available you donâ€™t have to display a close button.
