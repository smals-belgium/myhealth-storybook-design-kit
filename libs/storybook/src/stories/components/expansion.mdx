# Expansion

> The expansion component is based of Angular Material's [expansion](https://material.angular.io/components/expansion). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **expansion component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-expansion();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```
