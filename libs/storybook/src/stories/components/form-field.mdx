# Form field

> The form field component is based of Angular Material's [form field](https://material.angular.io/components/form-field). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **form field component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-form-field();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

### Class for labels

The MyHealth Design System requires labels to be outside of the input field. To achieve this, use the following class: `mh-form-field` on a div around the form field.
Make sure the label is linked to the input field by using the `for` attribute on the label and the `id` attribute on the input field.

An example on how to use this class:

```html
<div class="mh-form-field">
  <label for="field1">Label</label>
  <mat-form-field appearance="outline">
    <input id="field1" matInput placeholder="Placeholder" [formControl]="myInputControl" />
    <mat-icon matSuffix>sentiment_very_satisfied</mat-icon>
    <mat-hint>Hint text</mat-hint>
  </mat-form-field>
</div>
```
