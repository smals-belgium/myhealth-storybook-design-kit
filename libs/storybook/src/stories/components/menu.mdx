# Menu

> Menu's or Dropdown buttons are button elements that allow users to select an item or action from a list by clicking on a button and revealing a dropdown.
> Clicking on one of the exposed options triggers the action.
>
> The menu component is based of Angular Material's [menu](https://material.angular.io/components/menu). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **menu component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-menu();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

## Usage guidelines

Use it as a menu or use it as dropdown buttons when there's no default action and more than two actions need to be presented.

### Disable state

- When a dropdown button is used in combination with a multi select (table or card list items), some actions may become inactive. In that case, never change the order but make sure the disable ones are grayed out.

### Hierarchy when used as dropdown button

- Start with main actions
- Destructive actions should be separated from the other actions by a divider (last option of the list)
