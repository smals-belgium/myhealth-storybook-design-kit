# Progress bar
> The progress bar component is based of Angular Material's [progress bar](https://material.angular.io/components/progress-bar). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

### Usage

To use the **progress bar component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-progress-bar();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

### Usage guidelines
Whenever the action might take more than 3 seconds, use a progress bar instead of a spinning gear.
Unlike spinning gears progress bars also give a sense of the progress made and of how much more work needs to be done.
Their downside is that they demand more user attention and are more disruptive, so thatâ€™s why they are generally not needed for quick actions that take around less than 3 seconds.
