# Progress spinner

> The progress spinner component is based of Angular Material's [progress spinner](https://material.angular.io/components/progress-spinner). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

<Canvas of={ProgressStories.Spinner} sourceState="none" />

## Usage

To use the **progress spinner component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

## Usage guidelines

Whenever the action will take **less than 3 seconds**, use a progress spinning.
