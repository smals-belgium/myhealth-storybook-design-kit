# Progress Indicators
> Use a dynamic progress indicator for any action that takes longer than 1 second.
>
> Mobile users are often impatient and distracted by external factors. Without a visible progress indicator, they may assume the site or app is broken and abandon the task.

## Progress Spinner
Use a progress spinner when the action takes **less than 3 seconds** to complete. Spinners communicate that something is happening without distracting the user too much.

## Progress Bar
Use a progress bar for actions that take **longer than 3 seconds**. Unlike spinners, progress bars provide feedback on how much of the task is completed and how much remains.

While progress bars offer more information, they also demand more user attention and can feel more disruptive. For this reason, theyâ€™re typically reserved for longer tasks.

## Skeleton Screens
For **pages that take longer to load**, show a skeleton screen first.
Skeleton screens display the structure of the page (e.g., layout and components) without content, helping users understand what to expect while they wait.

They reduce perceived loading time by giving users something to look at and anticipate, rather than a blank or static screen.
