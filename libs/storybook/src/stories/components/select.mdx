<Meta title="Angular Components/Form Field/Select" />

# Select

> The select component is based of Angular Material's [select](https://material.angular.io/components/select). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

The select utilises the [form field component](/docs/components-form-field--docs) for its styling.
You must therefore also include the form field component in your project.
Make sure to also include the `mh-form-field` class (described in the [form field component](/docs/components-form-field--docs)) around the select component, if you want to achieve the desired label.

To use the **select component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-form-field();
@include mh.override-mat-select();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```
