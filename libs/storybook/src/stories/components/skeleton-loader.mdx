# Skeleton loader

> Skeleton loaders are, in simplest terms, a static / animated placeholder for the information that is still loading. It mimic the structure and look of the entire view.
> It gives an idea regarding what kind of content is loading in each block like image, text, long text etc.
>
> My Health uses the [ngx-skeleton-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-skeleton-loader) package for its skeleton loaders.
> Documentation on how to use this skeleton loader can be found here as well.

This document is meant to show how we implement the skeleton loader in various parts of the MyHealth application.

## Table

In a [table](/docs/components-table--docs), we use the skeleton loader whenever data is being loaded, and the component thus comes into a **loading state**.

To make sure there are **no jumps** in our page when switching between states, we calculate the `count` of skeleton loader lines that should be shown,
as well as change the `height` of the lines to whatever fits for your table.

When `isLoading` is set to `true`, we want to make sure all data rows are hidden and the skeleton loader is visible.

In this example, `dataSource` is our Material DataSource variable, and `pageSize` is the maximum page size of our MatPaginator.

```ts
dataSource: MatTableDataSource<any> = new MatTableDataSource<any>([]);
pageSize: number = 10;
isLoading: boolean = false;
```

```html
  ...
  <!-- Data row -->
  <tr [hidden]="isLoading" mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: columns"></tr>
</table>

@if (isLoading) {
  <ngx-skeleton-loader
    [count]="dataSource.data.length <= 0 ? 3 : dataSource.data.length > pageSize ? pageSize : dataSource.data.length"
    appearance="line"
    [theme]="{
      height: '47px',
      margin: '0'
    }"
  />
}
```
