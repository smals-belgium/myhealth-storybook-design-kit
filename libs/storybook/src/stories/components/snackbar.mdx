# Snackbar

> **Success messages**<br />
> Snackbars inform users of successful outcomes or actions.
> They provide lightweight feedback without interrupting the user's flow and disappear after a short duration or when the user interacts with the screen.
>
> The snackbar component is based of Angular Material's [snackbar](https://material.angular.io/components/snack-bar). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Snackbar best practices

You can pass some standardized properties to the Angular Material snackbar.
My Health chose to always show a `Close` **button**, as well as to **automatically close** the snackbar after `5000ms`.

## Usage

To use the **snackbar component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-snackbar();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

When calling the `snackbar.open()` method, pass the **custom class** `mh-snackbar--success` from My Health into the `panelClass` option to use My Health styling:

```ts
openSnackbar(): void {
  this.snackbar.open('I am a snackbar!', 'Close', {
    panelClass: 'mh-snackbar--success',
    duration: 5000,
  });
}
```
