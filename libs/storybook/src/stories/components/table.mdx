# Table

> The table component is based of Angular Material's [table](https://material.angular.io/components/table). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **table component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-table();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

## Usage guidelines

### Desktop view

<Canvas of={TableStories.Default} sourceState="none" />

#### Expandable Table

The Design Kit offers support for expandable tables, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-expandable-rows).
The implementation remains largely the same, it is only a matter of adding the right classes:

The detail row in your table needs the class `mh-detail-row`:

```html
<!-- Detail row -->
<tr class="mh-detail-row" mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: ['expandDetail']"></tr>
```

In your `expandDetail` column's definition, add the class `mh-detail-row--expanded` when the row is expanded:

```html
<!-- Expanded Content Column - The detail row is made up of this one column that spans across all columns -->
<ng-container matColumnDef="expandDetail">
  <td
    mat-cell
    *matCellDef="let element"
    [class.mh-detail-row--expanded]="element === expandedElement"
    [colSpan]="columns.length"
  >
    <div>
      <!-- Detail content goes here -->
    </div>
  </td>
</ng-container>
```

Avoid repeating data from the collapsed panel. When users expand a row, they should be presented with new content only—don’t make them work to find what’s changed or added.

#### Table with selection

The Design Kit also supports tables with selection, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.dev/components/table/examples#table-selection).
The implementation remains largely the same; it's simply a matter of adding the appropriate class for the pointer cursor.

The data row in your table needs the class `mh-cursor-pointer`:

```html
<!-- Data row -->
<tr mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: columns()" (click)="clickRow(row)" class="mh-cursor-pointer"></tr>
```

#### Table with filtering

The Design Kit also supports tables with filter, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.dev/components/table/examples#table-filtering).
The implementation remains largely the same; only the input field changes to a search input with icon and the the appropriate class.

The form field needs the class `mh-table__search` and appearance `outline`; <br />
the input needs the class `mh-table__search__input`

```html
<!-- input -->
<mat-form-field appearance="outline" class="mh-table__search">
  <mat-icon matPrefix fontIcon="search" aria-hidden="true" />
  <input
    matInput
    type="text"
    class="mh-table__search__input"
    name="search"
    (keyup)="applyFilter($event)"
    placeholder="Search ..."
    #input
  />
</mat-form-field>
```

#### Loading state

For documentation on how to style the loading state of the table, see the [Skeleton loader docs](/docs/components-skeleton-loader--docs#table).

## Component variations

### With toolbars

> Use toolbars for searching, filtering, and other global actions that apply to the entire table.
> In long lists, allow users to type the first letters of the desired item to quickly navigate to it, instead of requiring them to scroll.

<b>Desktop view</b>
<Canvas of={TableStories.Filter} sourceState="none" />

### With Selection

> The selection variant enables users to select individual rows in a data table. Selection options include:
>
> - Single-select: Radio buttons
> - Multi-select: Checkboxes
>
> Users can perform individual or batch actions on the selected items.
