# Table

> The table component is based of Angular Material's [table](https://material.angular.io/components/table). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **table component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-table();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

## Usage guidelines

### Desktop view

> A table displays data in rows and columns, making it easy to compare and analyze information in a structured format.

<Canvas of={TableStories.Default} sourceState="none" />

### Mobile view

> On mobile devices, tables should transform into cards to preserve readability and avoid horizontal scrolling.<br />
> Each row becomes a **card of the same size**.<br />
> Cards are use as entry points to a full page with further details.<br/>
>
> Don't use the layout of a card to group together a set of non-clickable information (use a single line to separate the various items, or a different background color).

Implement breakpoints to display a table layout on desktop and automatically switch to a card layout on mobile devices for optimal display.

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

/* By default (mobile): show cards, hide table */
.desktop-table {
  display: none;
}

.mobile-cards {
  display: block; /* or flex/grid/... */
}

/* From 600px and up (tablet and desktop): show table, hide cards */
@media (min-width: mh.$media-breakpoint-xs) {
  table {
    display: table; /* show the table */
  }

  .card {
    display: none; /* hide the cards */
  }
}
```

```html
<!-- input -->
<Card class="mobile-cards" />
<table class="desktop-table" />
```

## Component variations

### Desktop

#### Sortable Table

The Design Kit offers support for sortable tables, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.dev/components/table/examples#table-sorting).
The implementation remains largely the same; it's simply a matter of adding the appropriate elements inside of the sortable headers.

The only change is that the **sortable header needs to include a sort icon:** `<mat-icon fontIcon="swap_vert" />`.

```html
<!-- Sortable column -->
<ng-container matColumnDef="columnName">
  <th mat-header-cell mat-sort-header *matHeaderCellDef>
    <span>Column Name</span>
    <mat-icon fontIcon="swap_vert" />
  </th>
  <td mat-cell *matCellDef="let element">{{ element.columnName }}</td>
</ng-container>
```

#### Expandable Table

The Design Kit offers support for expandable tables, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-expandable-rows).
The implementation remains largely the same, it is only a matter of adding the right classes:

The detail row in your table needs the class `mh-detail-row`, as well as the `mh-detail-row--expanded` class when the row is expanded:

```html
<!-- Detail row -->
<tr
  class="mh-detail-row"
  mat-row
  *matRowDef="let row; columns: ['expandDetail']"
  [class.mh-detail-row--expanded]="row.index === expandedElementIndex()"
  [hidden]="row.index !== expandedElementIndex()"
  [id]="'detail-row-' + row.index"
></tr>
```

Avoid repeating data from the collapsed panel. When users expand a row, they should be presented with new content only—don’t make them work to find what’s changed or added.

<Canvas of={TableStories.Expandable} sourceState="none" />

##### Expandable Table: Accessibility

To enhance accessibility for expandable tables, it's important to manage the visibility of detail rows and its ARIA-attributes effectively.

As such, the **detail row** should include:

- The `hidden` attribute when it is not expanded. This ensures that screen readers do not announce content that is not currently visible to users.
- An `id` attribute that links to the corresponding control button in the actions column. This helps users of assistive technologies to understand the relationship between the button and the content it controls.

```html
<!-- Detail row -->
<tr
  class="mh-detail-row"
  mat-row
  *matRowDef="let row; columns: ['expandDetail']"
  [class.mh-detail-row--expanded]="row.index === expandedElementIndex()"
  [hidden]="row.index !== expandedElementIndex()"
  [id]="'detail-row-' + row.index"
></tr>
```

The **expansion button** should include:

- An `aria-label` that clearly indicates the action of the button, such as "Show more" or "Show less", depending on the current state.
- The `aria-expanded` attribute to indicate whether the associated detail row is currently expanded or collapsed.
- The `aria-controls` attribute that references the `id` of the corresponding detail row.

```html
<!-- Expansion button in actions column -->
<button
  mat-icon-button
  type="button"
  [attr.aria-label]="expandedElementIndex() === element.index ? 'Show less' : 'Show more'"
  [attr.aria-expanded]="expandedElementIndex() === element.index"
  [attr.aria-controls]="'detail-row-' + element.index"
  (click)="setExpandedIndex(element.index)"
>
  <mat-icon [fontIcon]="expandedElementIndex() === element.index ? 'keyboard_arrow_up' : 'keyboard_arrow_down'" />
</button>
```

##### Legacy expandable table (deprecated)

This is the implementation of the expandable table before version 4.1.0 of the Design Kit. It is now deprecated in favor of the new implementation above.
The deprecated implementation relied on adding the expanded class to the content cells instead of the detail row.

The detail row in your table needs the class `mh-detail-row`:

```html
<!-- Detail row -->
<tr class="mh-detail-row" mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: ['expandDetail']"></tr>
```

In your `expandDetail` column's definition, add the class `mh-detail-row--expanded` when the row is expanded:

```html
<!-- Expanded Content Column - The detail row is made up of this one column that spans across all columns -->
<ng-container matColumnDef="expandDetail">
  <td
    mat-cell
    *matCellDef="let element"
    [class.mh-detail-row--expanded]="element === expandedElement"
    [colSpan]="columns.length"
  >
    <div>
      <!-- Detail content goes here -->
    </div>
  </td>
</ng-container>
```

#### Table with selection

The Design Kit also supports tables with selection, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.dev/components/table/examples#table-selection).
The implementation remains largely the same; it's simply a matter of adding the appropriate class for the pointer cursor.

The data row in your table needs the class `mh-cursor-pointer`:

```html
<!-- Data row -->
<tr mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: columns()" (click)="clickRow(row)" class="mh-cursor-pointer"></tr>
```

The selection variant enables users to select individual rows in a data table.
Users can perform individual or batch actions on the selected items.

<Canvas of={TableStories.Selection} sourceState="none" />

#### Table with filtering

The Design Kit also supports tables with filter, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.dev/components/table/examples#table-filtering).
The implementation remains largely the same; only the input field changes to a search input with icon and the the appropriate class.

The form field needs the class `mh-table__search` and appearance `outline`; <br />
the input needs the class `mh-table__search__input`

```html
<!-- input -->
<mat-form-field appearance="outline" class="mh-table__search">
  <mat-icon matPrefix fontIcon="search" aria-hidden="true" />
  <input
    matInput
    type="text"
    class="mh-table__search__input"
    name="search"
    (keyup)="applyFilter($event)"
    placeholder="Search ..."
    #input
  />
</mat-form-field>
```

Allow users to type the first letters of the desired item to quickly navigate to the item of interest instead of having to scroll to it.
Place the search field at the top of the list.

<Canvas of={TableStories.Filter} sourceState="none" />

#### Loading state

For documentation on how to style the loading state of the table, see the [Skeleton loader docs](/docs/components-skeleton-loader--docs#table).

### Mobile

#### Without labels

When values are self-explanatory, labels may be omitted to reduce the size of the cards. This is the case, for example, in the drug prescription list.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Not_Labelled} sourceState="none" />

- Use mainly Body default regular for content
- Use Body default bold sparingly (only for key information)
- Text should be left-aligned
- Use blue only for information (info alert)

##### With labels

Display the label and value stacked vertically, one above the other.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Labelled} sourceState="none" />

- Put the label and value one above each other
- Use Body default bold for the label
- Use Body default regular for the values
- For cards containing a tag, the presence of a label is mandatory when the meaning of it isn’t self-explanatory (e.g. expiration date).

In both variants, text should be left-aligned. <br />
Left-aligned text is easier to read because the eye doesn't need to search for the start of each line—it's always in the same place.
