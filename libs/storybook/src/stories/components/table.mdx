# Table

> The table component is based of Angular Material's [table](https://material.angular.io/components/table). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **table component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-table();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

## Expandable Table

The Design Kit offers support for expandable tables, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-expandable-rows).
The implementation remains largely the same, it is only a matter of adding the right classes:

The detail row in your table needs the class `mh-detail-row`:

```html
<!-- Detail row -->
<tr class="mh-detail-row" mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: ['expandDetail']"></tr>
```

In your `expandDetail` column's definition, add the class `mh-detail-row--expanded` when the row is expanded:

```html
<!-- Expanded Content Column - The detail row is made up of this one column that spans across all columns -->
<ng-container matColumnDef="expandDetail">
  <td
    mat-cell
    *matCellDef="let element"
    [class.mh-detail-row--expanded]="element === expandedElement"
    [colSpan]="columns.length"
  >
    <div>
      <!-- Detail content goes here -->
    </div>
  </td>
</ng-container>
```

## Loading state

For documentation on how to style the loading state of the table, see the [Skeleton loader docs](/docs/components-skeleton-loader--docs#table).
