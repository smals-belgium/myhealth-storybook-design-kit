# Table

> The table component is based of Angular Material's [table](https://material.angular.io/components/table). Material's core features will remain the same and can be implemented in the same way.
> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit will simply overrule the component's styling.

## Usage

To use the **table component** My Health styles, include them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-mat-table();
```

Alternatively, you can use **all component** My Health styles by including them in your root SCSS file:

```css
@use '@myhealth-belgium/design-kit' as mh;

@include mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

## Usage guidelines

### Desktop view
<Canvas of={TableStories.Default} sourceState="none" />

#### Expandable Table

The Design Kit offers support for expandable tables, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.io/components/table/examples#table-expandable-rows).
The implementation remains largely the same, it is only a matter of adding the right classes:

The detail row in your table needs the class `mh-detail-row`:

```html
<!-- Detail row -->
<tr class="mh-detail-row" mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: ['expandDetail']"></tr>
```

In your `expandDetail` column's definition, add the class `mh-detail-row--expanded` when the row is expanded:

```html
<!-- Expanded Content Column - The detail row is made up of this one column that spans across all columns -->
<ng-container matColumnDef="expandDetail">
  <td
    mat-cell
    *matCellDef="let element"
    [class.mh-detail-row--expanded]="element === expandedElement"
    [colSpan]="columns.length"
  >
    <div>
      <!-- Detail content goes here -->
    </div>
  </td>
</ng-container>
```

Avoid repeating data from the collapsed panel. When users expand a row, they should be presented with new content only—don’t make them work to find what’s changed or added.

#### Table with selection
The Design Kit also supports tables with selection, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.dev/components/table/examples#table-selection).
The implementation remains largely the same; it's simply a matter of adding the appropriate class for the pointer cursor.

The data row in your table needs the class `mh-cursor-pointer`:

```html
<!-- Data row -->
<tr mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: columns()"  (click)="clickRow(row)" class="mh-cursor-pointer"></tr>
```

#### Table with filtering
The Design Kit also supports tables with filter, as seen in Angular Material's [example](https://material.angular.dev/components/table/examples#table-filtering).
The implementation remains largely the same; only the input field changes to a search input with icon and the the appropriate class.

The form field needs the class `mh-table__search` and appearance `outline`; <br />
the input needs the class `mh-table__search__input`

```html
<!-- input -->
<mat-form-field appearance="outline" class="mh-table__search">
    <mat-icon matPrefix fontIcon="search" aria-hidden="true" />
    <input matInput type="text" class="mh-table__search__input" name="search" (keyup)="applyFilter($event)" placeholder="Search ..." #input>
</mat-form-field>
```

#### Loading state

For documentation on how to style the loading state of the table, see the [Skeleton loader docs](/docs/components-skeleton-loader--docs#table).

### Mobile view
> On mobile devices, tables should transform into cards to preserve readability and avoid horizontal scrolling.<br />
> Each row becomes a card.
>
> Implement a device-based switch in your HTML that shows the table layout on desktop and automatically switches to the card layout on mobile devices to ensure optimal display.

```javascript
<!-- input -->
 isMobileNative = false;

  ngOnInit() {
    // Use isMobileNative to determine initial view mode
    this.isMobileNative = isMobileNative();
  }
```

```html
<!-- input -->
 @if(isMobileNative) {
  <Card />
 } @else {
  <Table />
 }
```

<div class="image-wrapper">
<img src="/images/default-card.png" alt="Card on mobile view" />
</div>

#### With labels
Display the label and value stacked vertically, one above the other.

#### Without labels
When values are self-explanatory, labels may be omitted to reduce the size of the cards. This is the case, for example, in the drug prescription list.

In both variants, text should be left-aligned. <br />
Left-aligned text is easier to read because the eye doesn't need to search for the start of each line—it's always in the same place.

## Component variations
### With toolbars
> Use toolbars for searching, filtering, and other global actions that apply to the entire table.
> In long lists, allow users to type the first letters of the desired item to quickly navigate to it, instead of requiring them to scroll.

<b>Desktop view</b>
<Canvas of={TableStories.Filter} sourceState="none" />

<b>Mobile view</b>
<div class="image-wrapper">
<img src="/images/card-with-filters.png" alt="Card on mobile view with toolbars" />
<img src="/images/card-filters-open.png" alt="Card on mobile view with filter open" />
</div>

#### Types of actions
* **Icon Button**: Use when multiple actions are possible in a row, or when there isn’t enough space for labels. Ensure the icon is well-known and include an ARIA label.
* **Overflow Menu**: Use when there are more than three actions, or when there isn’t enough space to display all actions as icon buttons.
<div class="image-wrapper">
<img src="/images/card-with-actions.png" alt="Card on mobile view with more then 3 actions" />
</div>

### With Selection
> The selection variant enables users to select individual rows in a data table. Selection options include:
>
> * Single-select: Radio buttons
> * Multi-select: Checkboxes
>
> Users can perform individual or batch actions on the selected items.

<b>Desktop view</b>
<Canvas of={TableStories.Selection} sourceState="none" />

<b>Mobile view</b>
<div class="image-wrapper">
<img src="/images/card-with-select.png" alt="Card on mobile view with checkbox" />
</div>

{/*
### Decks of cards
> The so-called “deck of cards” mimics the arrangement of pages in a book. Each list element is displayed on a “card,” and each card represents a page in a stack. This layout functions as a carousel, where each item occupies the entire screen.
>
> Decks of cards are not ideal for lists longer than 4–6 elements, as they require sequential access—users must inspect each page one by one before reaching the desired content.
>
> Use case: The Bundle
