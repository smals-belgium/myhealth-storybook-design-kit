# Accessibility

> Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.
> We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities,
> but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

## Introduction

The WCAG is a shared standard for web content accessibility for individuals, organizations, and governments. There are three levels of accessibility compliance in the WCAG, which reflect the priority of support:

- A (essential): if this isn't met, assistive technology may not be able to read, understand, or fully operate the page or view.
- AA (ideal support): required for multiple government and public body websites. We strive for AA compliance.
- AAA (specialized support): this is typically reserved for parts of websites and web apps that serve a specialized audience.

## Building inclusive experiences

Using our components is a way to improve accessibility and consistency when building products.

- The component library includes code we can use across applications.
- Since the code exists in a single component that gets reused, it's easier to update and fix any bugs.

The build-it-once, use-it-everywhere model means the accessibility knowledge of the designers and developers who build these components is available to all. Because of this, we are able to create a consistent experience that can be leveraged into accessible products.

It is important to make sure that components are integrated in a way that doesn't create unforeseen accessibility barriers. Depending how components are used, there may be more design and implementation considerations.

### Assistive technology support

Our components are tested for accessibility with automated and manual techniques. Users should expect to be able to access features built with our components using modern assistive technologies. These include native and third-party tools like:

- Screen readers
- Switch devices

### Coding standards

Our components start with web standards for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features from the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA or ARIA) specification are used to build functionality that is not available in native HTML.

### Alternative text

To help people who rely on assistive technologies, such as a screen reader or other text to speech programs, our components use alternative text for icons and images used to convey information and actions (like buttons and links).

### Meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

We targets WCAG 2.1 Level A and Level AA success criteria, and seeks to provide a highly usable experience for everyone.
