# Effects

> Effects are a way to add visual interest to your design. They can be subtle or bold, but they should always be intentional.
> Effects are mostly animations, but can also include shadows, gradients, and other visual enhancements.

## Shadows

Shadows are a way to add depth to your design. They can be used to create a sense of hierarchy, or to make elements appear to float above the page.
Use shadows in CSS like so: `box-shadow: $<shadow-variable>`.

An overview of all values used for `box-shadow`:

<Markdown>{`
| token                    | value                                 |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| \`$box-shadow-dropdown\` | 0px 1px 9px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) |
`}</Markdown>

## Gradients

Gradients are a way to add color and visual interest to your design. They can be used to create depth, or to draw attention to a specific element.

You can use the following SCSS function to add a gradient with MyHealth's primary colors to an element: `gradient-light($rotation, $positionPrimary, $positionAccent)`.

For example:

```scss
background: mh.gradient-light(315deg, 0%, 100%);
```
