# Mixins & optimization

> To optimize the Design Kit and make packages as small as possible, you can choose to include a select amount of mixins to suit your application's needs.
> Instead of calling `core()`, you can handpick the mixins that are relevant for your application.

## core

The `core($use-material, $use-local-fonts)` mixin is the base of the design kit.

This mixin allows the following variables to be passed: `$use-material: boolean`, `$use-local-fonts: boolean`.

- `$use-material` is a boolean that dictates if `core()` **includes Angular Material** theme in the design kit or not.
- `$use-local-fonts` is a boolean that dictates if `core()` includes the **local fonts or** gets them from the **Google Fonts CDN**.
- `$symbols-font-path` is a string that specifies the path to the Material Symbols font file. This is only used if `$use-local-fonts` is set to `true`.

This mixin in turn calls following mixins:

- [use-font-open-sans($use-local-fonts)](#use-font-open-sans)
- [use-font-material-symbols($use-local-fonts)](#use-font-material-symbols)
- [use-globals()](#use-globals)
- [use-classes()](#use-classes)
- [use-all-components()](#use-all-components)

Optional:

- [mh-material-theme()](#mh-material-theme)

### use-font-open-sans

The `use-font-open-sans($use-material, $use-local-fonts)` includes the Open Sans font into SCSS `@font-face`.

This mixin allows the following variables to be passed: `$use-local-fonts: boolean`.

- `$use-local-fonts` is a boolean that dictates if `use-font-open-sans()` includes the **local fonts or** gets them from the **Google Fonts CDN**.

### use-font-material-symbols

The `use-font-material-symbols($use-material, $use-local-fonts)` includes the Open Sans font into SCSS `@font-face`.

This mixin allows the following variables to be passed: `$use-local-fonts: boolean`.

- `$use-local-fonts` is a boolean that dictates if `use-font-open-sans()` includes the **local fonts or** gets them from the **Google Fonts CDN**.
- `$symbols-font-path` is a string that specifies the path to the Material Symbols font file. This is only used if `$use-local-fonts` is set to `true`.

#### Optimization

By default, the Material icons included with the design kit contain **all variable Material Symbols**.
This package is naturally quite large, and can be reduced significantly by only including the symbols that are actually used in the application.

You can do so by selecting the symbols you need directly in the [Google Fonts CDN](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.style=Rounded),
and importing them in your project instead of calling `use-font-material-symbols()`.

### use-globals

The `use-globals()` mixin includes global styles onto HTML elements. It utilizes the MyHealth default fonts and colors to do so.
The following HTML elements are styled:

- `body` (Remove margins, add default font, add background-color and color)
- `h1`-`h6`
- `p`
- `a`

### use-classes

The `use-classes()` mixin instantiates various classes used throughout the MyHealth application.

- `sr-only`: Hides an element visually, but keeps it accessible for screen readers.
- `d-none`: Sets the display of an element to hidden.
- `mh-container`: Similar to Bootstrap's container, a scalable container to center content on the page.

### use-all-components

Specifies specific CSS classes that utilized by specific components in MyHealth.

- `table`: Used for styling tables.
- `option-button`: Used to style large option buttons.

### mh-material-theme

The `mh-material-theme()` mixin is used to instantiate the Angular Material theme.
The mixin implements Angular's base theming mixins declared in [their theming documentation](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming).

This mixin in turn uses the [MyHealth Material palette](/docs/foundations-material--docs). Which's variables are available in the design kit.

## Utilities

The following mixins are standalone utilities and can be used without calling `core()`:

- `icon-size($size)`: Sets the size of a Material icon.

## Material overrides

Material overrides are used to change the default Material component styling to fit MyHealth's style.

You can override all Material components at once with this SCSS mixin, provided Angular Material has been instantiated:

```scss
mh.override-all-mat-components();
```

Material components can be overridden **individually** as well, to do this, view the documentaiton provided with each specific component.

### override-mat-select-arrow

The `override-mat-select-arrow($icon, $font-family)` mixin is used to override the default Material dropdown arrow in a select.

This mixin allows the following variables to be passed: `$icon: string`, `$font-family: string`.

- `$icon` dictates the icon to be used as the dropdown arrow.
- `$font-family` dictates the font family to be used for the icon.

By default, the Material dropdown arrow is replaced with the Material icon `'keyboard_arrow_down'`, using font `'Material Symbols Rounded'`.

## Typography

The Design Kit specifies mixins for all font types, these are consumed by f.e. the [use-globals](#use-globals) mixin.
You can find a list of all available mixins in our [Typography docs](/docs/foundations-typography--docs#presets).

To find out what exactly is defined for these mixins, view the `scss/core/typography/mixins.scss` file in the package.
These mixins may be subject to change and/or rename in the future.
