# Changelog Design Kit

## 4.1.0 (16 December 2025)

**New features:**

- Aligned the checkbox for [Checkbox component](/story/angular-components-selectors-checkbox--default) with the first line of the label text.
  This improves readability and accessibility, especially for checkboxes with multi-line labels.
- Aligned the radio button for [Radio Button component](/story/angular-components-selectors-radio-button--default) with the first line of the label text.
  This improves readability and accessibility, especially for radio buttons with multi-line labels.
- Added the `mh-input-suffix` class to the [Form Field component](/docs/components-form-field--docs) documentation.
  This class should be used when adding a textual suffix to an input field to ensure proper styling and alignment.
- Added the `mh-suffix-error` class to the [Form Field component](/docs/components-form-field--docs) documentation.
  This class should be used when adding an error icon as a suffix to an input field to ensure proper styling and alignment.

**Fixzed bugs:**

- Fixed styling inconsistencies for dialog component.

**Removed features:**

- Removed deprecated typography color tokens: `$typography-semantic-success` and `$typography-semantic-warning`.
  These have been replaced by `$typography-semantic-success-medium` and `$typography-semantic-warning-medium` respectively.
  Please update your code accordingly if you are still using the deprecated tokens.
- Removed deprecated typography color token: `$typography-brand-neutral-light`.
  This token is no longer used in the design system and has been removed to prevent confusion.

**Updated documentation:**

- Updated [Color Tokens documentation](/docs/foundations-color-tokens--docs) to reflect the removal of deprecated typography color tokens.
- Updated [Typography](/docs/foundations-typography--docs) to reflect the actual code mixins (mistakes in documentation).
- Added checkbox group example to [Checkbox documentation](/story/angular-components-selectors-checkbox--checkbox-group).
- Updated [Dialog documentation](/docs/angular-components-dialog--docs) to include guidelines on dialog actions alignment.

## 4.0.0 (15 December 2025)

**Potentially breaking changes:**

- Removed the `$use-local-fonts` parameter from the `mh.core()`, `mh.use-font-open-sans()` and `mh.use-font-material-symbols()` mixins.
  The design kit will now always load fonts locally to improve performance, privacy and security.
  Make sure to include the font files in your application when using the design kit.

## 3.1.0 (3 October 2025)

**Added features:**

- Added optional parameters to the `mh.core()` mixin called `$symbols-font-family` & `$symbols-font-classes`.
  This change is required for the development of webcomponents, to include an icon asset font with an unique name that does not get
  overruled by other CSS classes and font-faces with the same name.
  By default, these parameters are set to `'Material Symbols Rounded'` and `('material-icons', 'material-symbols')` respectively,
  this ensure behavior remains the same if no changes are made.
- Added the font-face for `Material Symbols Rounded Chevrons` to the design kit, as this is used in the select component.
  This removes the option to pass a custom font-family to the `mh.override-mat-select-arrow()` mixin, as this is now always
  set to `Material Symbols Rounded Chevrons` for consistency.
