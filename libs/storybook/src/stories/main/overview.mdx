# My Health belgium.be (MH) Design Kit

> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit is built to be used with Angular 19 and Angular Material.
> The main focus of the kit is to make an application with excellent accessibility and design features, hence why Angular Material is used as a base.
> MH's Design Kit will then overrule some of Angular Material's CSS to make it fit to the MH style.

# Myhealth Additional UI Components (@myhealth-belgium/myhealth-additional-ui-components)

> A separate package exists for all the reusable components used in the context of the My Health web Portal and mobile application, which are not a simple overrides of Angular Material components.
> this package needs to be installed separately
