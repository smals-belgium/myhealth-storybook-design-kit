# My Health belgium.be (MH) Design Kit

> The My Health belgium.be Design Kit is built to be used with Angular 19 and Angular Material.
> The main focus of the kit is to make an application with excellent accessibility and design features, hence why Angular Material is used as a base.
> MH's Design Kit will then overrule some of Angular Material's CSS to make it fit to the MH style.
